                Dear Simren,
                <br><br>
                If someone were to ask me about what makes me happy, the first thing I would say is that it's because of you.
                Dancing and laughing with you at Omnia was one of the most amazing nights of my life. To think that I managed
                to stay in contact with you and help us make our relationship happen is nothing short of a miracle.
                <br><br>
                Your willingness to get out of your comfort zone and visit me at Purdue was one of the sweetest things you
                could do. Our double date, our nights out, our walks together - all of them were some of the most amazing
                memories I have made. I loved being with you every second of that trip. Even to this day, you made the ups
                and downs of that semester worth it.
                <br><br>
                After visiting you in Santa Barbara and spending the most romantic nights going out with you, I felt sparks
                like never before. We clicked so well, and despite me feeling unwell, you were so sweet and welcoming to me.
                Everything you do for me makes me feel like the luckiest man alive.
                <br><br>
                I think that from the start, I've known that I wanted to be your boyfriend. 
                Nothing in this world lasts forever, which is why I want to cherish our lives together and celebrate this
                beautiful relationship. In this life, and all the rest, and whatever comes after, <h8>I love you, Simren.</h8>
                <br><br>
                From your cuteass,
                <br>
                Neil
